Recipe Vegetarian Hamburguer

Ingredients 

1 cup lentils 
2 1⁄2 cups water 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 tablespoon oil
2 cups flour 

Steps

1. Boil lentils in the water with the salt for around 45 minutes. Lentils will be soft and most of the water will be gone.
2. In a bowl mix the lentils with the flour since that you make a strong mass.
3. While still warm form the mixture into patties, it will make 8-10 burgers.
4. Each patty can then be shallow fried for 1-2 minutes on each side or baked at 200C for 15 minutes.
